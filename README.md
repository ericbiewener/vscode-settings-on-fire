# Settings on ðŸ”¥!

Define groups of settings to be easily toggled on and off. These may be defined in either global
User Settings or your current Workspace settings.

## Command
Provides a `Toggle Settings` command that can be used to toggle groups of settings on and off.

## Configuration Example
```json
"settingsOnFire.toggle": {
  "Color Theme": {
    "on": {
      "workbench.colorTheme": "Ayu Mirage"
    },
    "off": {
      "workbench.colorTheme": "Ayu Light"
    }
  },
  "Tests": {
    "on": {
      "files.exclude": {
        "**/__tests__": false,
        "**/__mocks__": false,
        "**/__fixtures__": false,
        "**/*.spec.js": false,
      }
    },
    "off": {
      "files.exclude": {
        "**/__tests__": true,
        "**/__mocks__": true,
        "**/__fixtures__": true,
        "**/*.spec.js": true,
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The keys `Color Theme` and `Tests` will appear in your command palette:

The "on" or "off" that you see in the screenshot indicates the state that the setting will be
changed to if you select it. Before ever toggling a setting, it will be considered to be `off`.

You can specify any amount of settings inside the `on` or `off`
definitions. These settings will simply be written to your top-level settings object.

## Labels
You may also include a `_label` key to provide more clarity around what toggling the setting will
do:

```json
"settingsOnFire.toggle": {
  "Color Theme": {
    "on": {
      "_label": "Dark",
      "workbench.colorTheme": "Ayu Mirage"
    },
    "off": {
      "_label": "Light",
      "workbench.colorTheme": "Ayu Light"
    }
  }
}
```

## Merging vs Overwriting Settings
Settings that are objects will be merged into existing settings, while any other type of value will
simply overwrite the previous setting. For example, the `Tests` settings above will merge the values
in `files.exclude` with whatever the current setting is for that key.
